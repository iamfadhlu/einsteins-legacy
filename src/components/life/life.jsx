                            Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, a town that today has a population of just more than 120,000.
                            His parents, secular Ashkenazi Jews, were Hermann Einstein(a salesman and engineer), and Pauline Koch.

                            In 1880, the family moved to Munich's borough of Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie,
                            a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.

                            Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich from the age of five.
                            When he was eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium, where he received advanced primary and then secondary school education.
                            In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company tendered for a contract to install electric lighting in Munich, but without success (they lacked the capital to update their technology from direct current to the more efficient, alternating current alternative.)

                            The failure of their bid forced them to sell their Munich factory and search for new opportunities elsewhere.
                            The Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia, where they settled in Palazzo Cornazzani.
                            15 year old Einstein stayed behind in Munich in order to finish his schooling.
                            His father wanted him to study electrical engineering, but he was a fractious pupil who found the Gymnasium's regimen and teaching methods far from congenial.
                            He later wrote that the school's policy of strict rote learning was harmful to creativity.

                            At the end of December 1894, a letter from a doctor persuaded the Luitpold's authorities to release him from its care, and he joined his family in Pavia.
                            While in Italy as a teenager, he wrote an essay entitled "On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field".
                            Einstein excelled at physics and mathematics from an early age, and soon acquired the mathematical expertise normally only found in a child several years his senior.

                            He began teaching himself algebra, calculus and Euclidean geometry when he was twelve; he made such rapid progress that he discovered an original proof of the Pythagorean theorem before his thirteenth birthday.
                            Einstein recorded that he had "mastered integral and differential calculus" while still just fourteen.
                            At thirteen, when his range of enthusiasms had broadened to include music and philosophy,Einstein was introduced to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Kant became his favorite philosopher.

                            In 1895, at the age of sixteen, Einstein sat the entrance examination for the federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Zürich, Switzerland.
                            He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the test,but performed with distinction in physics and mathematics.On the advice of the polytechnic's principal, he completed his secondary education at the Argovian cantonal school (a gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, graduating in 1896.
                            While lodging in Aarau with the family of Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. (His sister, Maja, later married Winteler's son Paul).

                            In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship of the German Kingdom of Württemberg in order to avoid conscription into military service.
                            At seventeen, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the federal polytechnic school. Marie Winteler, a year older than him, took up a teaching post in Olsberg, Switzerland.

                            The five other polytechnic school freshmen following the same course as Einstein included just one woman, a twenty year old Serbian, Mileva Marić.
                            Over the next few years, the pair spent many hours discussing their shared interests and learning about topics in physics that the polytechnic school's lectures did not cover.
                            In his letters to Marić, Einstein confessed that exploring science with her by his side was much more enjoyable than reading a textbook in solitude.
                            Eventually the two students became not only friends but also lovers.

                            (The fate of a child born to them in 1902 before their marriage, Lieserl, is unknown).

                            She returned to Zürich, taking Hans Albert and Eduard with her
                            Einstein and Marić were granted a divorce on 14 February 1919 on the grounds of having lived apart for five years.

                            As part of the divorce settlement, Einstein agreed that if he were to win a Nobel Prize, he would give the money that he received to Marić. He won the prize two years later
                            Einstein divorced Maric in 1919 and soon after married Elsa Löwenthal. Löwenthal died in 1933.
